- Support name placeholder macros of the form `\def\arnold/{Arnold Schwarzenegger}`.
- State where an error occurred:
  + parsing definitions
  + parsing tex
  + in all cases, in which file
  Using different exception types is probably the best way to do this.

- Replace constants with Enums

- Treat default arguments in Latex macros ?
